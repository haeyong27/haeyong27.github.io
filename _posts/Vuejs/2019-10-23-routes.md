## Named Routes
[Named Routes | Vue Router](https://router.vuejs.org/guide/essentials/named-routes.html)
Sometimes it is more convenient to identify a route with a name, especially when linking to a route or performing navigations. You can give a route a name in the routes options while creating the Router instance:

```javascript
const router = new VueRouter({
  routes: [
    {
      path: ‘/user/:userId’,
      name: ‘user’,
      component: User
    }
  ]
})
```

### To link to a named route, you can pass an object to the
```javascript
<router-link :to=“{ name: ‘user’, params: { userId: 123 }}”>User</router-link>
```


### This is the exact same object used programatically with
```javascript
router.push({ name: ‘user’, params: { userId: 123 }})
```

In both cases, the router will navigate to the path
