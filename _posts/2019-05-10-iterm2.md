Uninstalling Oh My Zsh
Oh My Zsh isn't for everyone. We'll miss you, but we want to make this an easy breakup.

If you want to uninstall oh-my-zsh, just run ```uninstall_oh_my_zsh``` from the command-line. It will remove itself and revert your previous bash or zsh configuration.

### reinstall

**As of today Nov 4, 2018 all the following methods works, install the zsh with:**  

```sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"```
